### SCHEDULED MESSAGES PLUGIN
# The scheduled messages plugin sends automated messages at configured intervals
# Configuration is in scheduled_messages.json (see scheduled_messages-example.json)
# No config.yml settings needed - all configuration is in the JSON file

### NODE TRACKING PLUGIN
# Tracks all nodes and packets received on the mesh network
# Stores data in SQLite database and exports to JSON for web visualization

  # Web server configuration (for viewing node data in browser)

    port: 8080                           # Port for web interface
  
  # Packet types to track (leave empty to track all types)

    link_timeout_minutes: 60             # Mark links inactive after this many minutes without packets
    min_packets_for_link: 3              # Minimum packets required to establish valid link
